## Details
**Context**:
This assessment will examine the student’s understanding of the data types and the fundamentals of Data Visualization. In particular, students are asked to write a short report (up to 8 pages using this template on “How would you visualize your data?”

**Topic**: How would you visualize your data?

**Preparation**:
To start your assignment, you first need to select the data you wish to visualize. These data might be from your previous studies, data from your work, any research project or some data you've obtained from elsewhere as long as your data contain at least 5 attributes (columns) with at least 3 different data types.

**Tasks**:
In your report, you are asked to describe and argue with appropriate references:
1. The nature of the data: what do those data represent/describe? how were they originally collected? (This is not asking where 'you' obtained this dataset from.)
2. Who are the consumers of such data? Why did they need this dataset? How are they using this dataset?
3. How are those data typically depicted or conveyed to those audiences? Present your explanation/argument with respect to data types and why the data needed to be visually represented in a certain way.
4. What sort of questions are asked and answered through such typical visualization you’ve mentioned in #3?
5. What might be typical mistakes people make in depicting those data?
6. How would YOU visualise those data differently? Using the symbolic representations from Semiology of Graphics, describe and explain how you would define the imposition of your visualisation, and how you would assign each data type to various visual variables.
7. Provide a sample of your visualization derived from the symbolic representation from #6. (You can use any visualization tool to create your visualization or you can provide hand sketches).
8. Explain how you derived your visualisation in #7 from the symbolic representation in #6.
9. Derive an equivalent but different symbolic representation of your answer from #6, and explain the equivalency. Simply reallocating different data elements to the different axis/visual variables within the same symbolic representation will not attract any marks.
10. Provide an example of your alternative visualization derived from the symbolic representation from #9, and describe/explain how you assigned each data type to be used for the axes and various visual variables. (You can use any visualization tool to create your visualization or you can provide hand sketches).

**Academic Integrity**:
This is an individually assessed assignment and you are not allowed to collaborate with your colleagues. If you use any external sources (journals, books, articles on the internet, etc) other than the material provided in the course, you must provide adequate/appropriate references/citations. For more details on Academic Integrity, please refer to the week 1 lecture. Your submission will be checked for plagiarism against external materials, and other students’ assignments (including past assignments) using TurnItIn).

**The use of Generative AI tools**:
The use of Generative AI tools to create any content included in your report is prohibited. The use of digital tools including Generative AI tools is permitted for the purpose of improving your English or proofreading. If you used any digital tools including Generative AI tools, you must provide appropriate citations/references describing the source and how it was used. You also need to keep records of the prompts you have used and the output you received from the digital tools. You may be asked to provide such records to validate the attribution of your work. Failing to provide the required record may result in being reported to the academic integrity case and facing potential disciplinary actions.

**Submission**:
Write your report(up to pages)using this template.(https:lledstem.orglaulcourses/16881/resources7download=18112)_We use this format and set the maximum page number in order to make the amount of work presented and processed by the markers consistent across all students. Not complying with the provided template will resut in a reduction of 5 marks.
Use this Canvas site to submit your report in the form of a PDF file,so that it can be checked using Turnitin.

**Due**:
The due is 13 Sep 2024 23:59.

You may only use generative artficia inteligence(AI) and automated writing tools in assessment tasks if you are permited to by your unit coordinator. If you do use these tools,you must acknowledge this in your work, eiher in a footnte or an acknowledgement section.For information on acknowledging
Al please refer to the guidance in the Al in Education Canvas site tp:cans.yey.eu,ucours/51655/pageslacknowldging-and-referencing: the-use-of-ai7module_item_ id=2027096)

We use Tumnin, hich inludes Al detection, to detect potentia intances of plagianism or other forms of academic integrity breach. if suh matches indicate evidence of plagiarism or other forms of academic integrity breaches,your teacher is required to report your work for further investigation.

Further information for on research integrity and ethics for postgraduate research students and students undertaking research-focussed coursework such as Honours and capstone research projects can be also be found on the current students website: htps:llsydney.edu.au/students/researchintegrity ethics.html(htps:/l/dny.du.au/students /research-integrity ethics.htm).
